Module 6.7

Theme idea for the return:

- Create an app using Next.js, Gatsby or another React Framework
- Connect it to a database and/or CMS (such as Prismic or WordPress)
- Deploy it in a cloud pldatform (such as Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, AWS or Digital Ocean)

I decided to do:

- - Portfolio directory

In this project I chose to use:
Next.js, prismic and vercel.
I have not used any of these, so this was a definite challenge to get through this project.
This is still a very interesting tool and will clearly delve deeper with them in module 7.

I link two img of prismic account and slice machine.
